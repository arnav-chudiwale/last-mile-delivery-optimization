PEAK SCENARIO ANALYSIS RESULTS - 

- Existing Data - 
1) Baseline Demand = 1490 packages 
2) Peak Demand = 3902 packages
3) Fleet Capacity = 32 small vans (50 packages/vehicle)
4) Capacity Shortfall = 2306 packages (59.04% of the peak demand)

- Business Impact - 
1) Scenario = DO NOTHING
- Service Failure = 59.8%
- Unserved Packages = 2306 packages 
- Late Delivery Penalties = $ 41,508 per day
- 5 day peak period TOTAL COST (with penalties) = $258,669.05

- Strategy Comparison Results

1. Overtime Only (10 hour shifts (8h -> 10h)) -- INFEASIBLE
- Service Level = 50.8% 
- FAILS to serve all demand

2. Outsource all overflow -- FEASIBLE BUT EXPENSIVE
- Total Cost = $39,051
- 59.0% of the peak demand outsourced

3. Hybrid: 2.0 hours overtime + Selective Outsourcing
- NOTE - 
- Additional Costs = Outsource Costs + Overtime Costs
- Total Costs = Baseline Costs + Additional Cost

- Extend driver shifts to 10 hours from 8 hours (2 hour overtime)
- 49.2% of the peak demand outsourced
- Baseline Cost = $10,225.81
- Outsource Cost = $24,025.00
- Overtime Cost (for 2 hours overtime) = $2400
- Additional Cost = $26,425.00
- TOTAL COST = $36,650.81
- Packages Outsourced = 1922 (49.2% of the total peak demand)

4. Hybrid: 1.6 hours (1 hour 36 mins) overtime + Selective Outsourcing
- NOTE - 
- Additional Costs = Outsource Costs + Overtime Costs
- Total Costs = Baseline Costs + Additional Cost

- 51.2% of the peak demand outsourced
- Baseline Cost = $10,225.81
- Outsource Cost = $24,987.50
- Overtime Cost (for 1 hour 36 minutes of overtime) = $1920
- Additional Cost = $26,907.50
- TOTAL COST = $37,133.31
- Packages Outsourced = 1999 (51.2% of the total peak demand)

5. Hybrid: 1.2 hours (1 hour 12 mins) overtime + Selective Outsourcing
- NOTE - 
- Additional Costs = Outsource Costs + Overtime Costs
- Total Costs = Baseline Costs + Additional Cost

- 53.1% of the peak demand outsourced
- Baseline Cost = $10,225.81
- Outsource Cost = $25,950.00
- Overtime Cost (for 1 hour 12 minutes of overtime) = $1440
- Additional Cost = $27,390.00
- TOTAL COST = $37,615.81
- Packages Outsourced = 2076 (53.1% of the total peak demand)

6. Hybrid: 0.8 hours (48 minutes) overtime + Selective Outsourcing
- NOTE - 
- Additional Costs = Outsource Costs + Overtime Costs
- Total Costs = Baseline Costs + Additional Cost

- 55.1% of the peak demand outsourced
- Baseline Cost = $10,225.81
- Outsource Cost = $26,912.50
- Overtime Cost (for 48 minutes of overtime) = $960
- Additional Cost = $27,872.50
- TOTAL COST = $38,098.31
- Packages Outsourced = 2076 (53.1% of the total peak demand)

- Recommended Strategy: 
- Hybrid: 2 hours extra overtime + selective outsourcing

- Reason - LEAST TOTAL COST OUT OF ALL STRATEGIES
- Cost per package = $9.38
